# Raffle Ticket selling ap

*This project is preserved mostly as an old archive of my past work*

**Project Date**
: July 2015

**Status**
: Archive

**Technologies**
: Java, PHP, MySQL, Android

This project includes an Android application written in Java, along with a PHP MySQL RESTFUL server, and a static HTML landing website. Using Paypal customers were able to purchase raffle tickets through the Android application on their phones. The iPhone app and feature to select a winner were never completed as the raffle missed the deadline to launch.

I've decided to open source this code since the application was delivered to users and is unlikely to be revived. This application was only briefly in the Google Play store.
